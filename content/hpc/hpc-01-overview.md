## Cluster hardware overview (17 min)

**Update 1**: Compute Canada has been replaced by the Digital Research Alliance of Canada (the Alliance). All
  Compute Canada hardware and services are now provided to researchers by the Alliance and its regional
  partners. However, you will still see many references to Compute Canada in
  [our documentation](https://docs.alliancecan.ca) and support system.

**Update 2**: New systems were added (Narval in Calcul Qu√©bec), and some older systems were upgraded.
