## About us

Since April 1, 2022 the advanced research computing / HPC training in Western Canada has been coordinated by the
[Digital Research Alliance of Canada](https://alliancecan.ca) and [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/) in collaboration with other
universities from British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. Consequently, "WestGrid summer school" has been renamed
"Western Canada Research Computing summer school".
