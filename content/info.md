## About this school

This research computing school is open to anyone working or studying at a Canadian post-secondary institution. It will run **online** from November 8 to 22, 2022.

It focuses on introductory topics and is a great foundation for our more advanced school coming up in the spring of 2023.

## Registration

## About us

Since April 1, 2022 the advanced research computing / HPC training in Western Canada has been coordinated by the
[Digital Research Alliance of Canada](https://alliancecan.ca) and [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/) in collaboration with other
universities from British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. Consequently, "WestGrid summer school" has been renamed
"Western Canada Research Computing summer school".
