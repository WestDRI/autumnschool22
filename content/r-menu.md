[R](https://www.r-project.org/){target="_blank"} is a free and open-source programming language for statistical computing, modelling, and graphics. One of the appeals of the language is the large collection of packages users have built, particularly in the fields of statistics, biology, bioinformatics, data mining, data analysis, and linguistics.

This introductory course does not assume any prior knowledge. It is aimed at setting the foundations on which more advanced courses will build later in the year.

**Instructor**: Marie-Helene Burle (SFU)

**Prerequisites:** none.

**Software**: 


<!-- - R: why and for whom? -->
<!-- why: free, open source, many packages, particularly for statistical modelling -->
<!-- for whom: tabular data, data science, biology, linguistics -->
<!-- some downsides too: slow, memory intensive, inconsistent, written by data scientists, not computer scientists -->
<!-- - What type of programming language is R? -->
<!-- functional -->
<!-- object-oriented -->
<!-- R follows a copy-on-modify system -->
<!-- - Resources -->
<!-- - R: the basics -->
<!-- - Packages -->
<!-- - The tidyverse -->
